# Open-Assistant Data Collection Discord Bot

This bot collects human feedback to create a dataset for RLHF-alignment of an assistant chat bot based on a large langugae model. You and other people can teach the bot how to respond to user requests by demonstration and by garding and ranking the bot's outputs. If you want to learn more about RLHF please refer [to OpenAI's InstructGPT blog post](https://openai.com/blog/instruction-following/).
